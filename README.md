# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project is a college assignment that implements three fundamental sorting algorithms:

- **Merge Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**

## Features
- Implementation of sorting algorithms in a structured manner.
- Algorithmic analysis of time complexity and efficiency.
- Well-documented code for easy understanding.
